You are given a 0-indexed integer array tasks, where tasks[i] represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level.

Return the minimum rounds required to complete all the tasks, or -1 if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def minimumRounds(self, tasks):
        """
        :type tasks: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        stack = {}
        result = 0
        for task in tasks:
            stack[task] = stack.get(task, 0) + 1

        for task in stack:
            if stack[task] == 1: 
                return -1
            else:
                result += ceil(stack[task]/3.0)
        return int(result)
```
