Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

# My first solution

```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def oddEvenList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        odd_list = ListNode()
        even_list = ListNode()
        odd_head = ListNode(next=odd_list).next
        even_head = ListNode(next=even_list).next
        
        while head:
            odd_list.next = ListNode(head.val)
            odd_list = odd_list.next
            head = head.next
            if not head:
                break
            even_list.next = ListNode(head.val)
            even_list = even_list.next
            head = head.next
        odd_list.next = even_head.next
        return odd_head.next
```

# more beautiful solution
```Python
class Solution(object):
    def oddEvenList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if(head==None):
            return head
        evenHead=head.next
        odd=head
        even=head.next
        while(even!=None and even.next!=None):
            odd.next=even.next
            odd=odd.next
            even.next=odd.next
            even=even.next

        odd.next=evenHead
        return head
```
