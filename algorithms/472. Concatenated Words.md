Given an array of strings words (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words.

A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

```Python
class Solution:
    def findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        s = set(words)
        for word in words:
            if self.checkConcatenated(word, s):
                result.append(word)
        return result

    
    def checkConcatenated(self, word, s):
        for i in range(len(word)):
            prefix = word[:i]
            suffix = word[i:]
            if prefix in s and (suffix in s or self.checkConcatenated(suffix, s)):
                return True
        return False
```
