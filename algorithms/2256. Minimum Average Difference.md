You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

The average difference of the index i is the absolute difference between the average of the first i + 1 elements of nums and the average of the last n - i - 1 elements. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Return the index with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.

Note:

- The absolute difference of two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.
- The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided (integer division) by n.
- The average of 0 elements is considered to be 0.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def minimumAverageDifference(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        min_avg = float('inf')
        min_ind = 0
        left_sum = 0
        right_sum = sum(nums)
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            left_sum += nums[i]
            right_sum -= nums[i]
            left_avg = left_sum / (i+1)
            right_avg = right_sum / (n-i-1) if (n-i-1) else 0
            new_avg = abs(left_avg - right_avg)
            if new_avg < min_avg:
                min_avg = new_avg
                min_ind = i
            if min_avg == 0:
                return min_ind
        return min_ind
```
