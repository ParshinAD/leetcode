You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        profit = 0
        min_value = prices[0]
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            new_profit = prices[i] - min_value
            if new_profit > profit:
                profit = new_profit
            if prices[i] < min_value:
                min_value = prices[i]
        return profit
```
