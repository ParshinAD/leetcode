You are given an array nums of n positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

- If the element is even, divide it by 2.
  - For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be [1,2,3,2].
- If the element is odd, multiply it by 2.
  - For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be [2,2,3,4].

The deviation of the array is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.

```Python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minimumDeviation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = [-num*2 if num%2 else -num for num in nums]
        heapq.heapify(nums)
        min_val = max(nums)
        curr_val = heapq.heappop(nums)
        min_div = -(curr_val - min_val)
        while not curr_val % 2:
            new_val = curr_val / 2
            heapq.heappush(nums, new_val)
            if new_val > min_val:
                min_val = new_val

            curr_val = heapq.heappop(nums)
            new_div = -(curr_val - min_val)
            if new_div < min_div:
                min_div = new_div
        
        return int(min_div)
```
