Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

# beats 97%

```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxLevelSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        stack = [(root,)]
        max_sum = [root.val, 1]
        level = 0
        while stack:
            curr_level = stack.pop()
            curr_sum, next_level = 0, []
            level += 1
            for node in curr_level:
                curr_sum += node.val
                if node.left is not None:
                    next_level.append(node.left)
                if node.right is not None:
                    next_level.append(node.right)
            if next_level:
                stack.append(next_level)
            if curr_sum > max_sum[0]:
                max_sum[0] = curr_sum
                max_sum[1] = level
        return max_sum[1]
