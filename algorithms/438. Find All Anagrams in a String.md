Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## My solution(bad)

```Python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        p1_counter = Counter(p)
        result = []
        for i in range(len(s)-len(p)+1):
            if p1_counter == Counter(s[i:i+len(p)]):
                result.append(i)
        return result
```
