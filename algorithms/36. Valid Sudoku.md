Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.

Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

## My solution
```Python
def small_square(board, x, y):
    elems = [elem for line in board[y: y+3] for elem in line[x: x+3]]
    return sorted(map(int, filter(str.isdigit, elems)))

def get_column(board, x):
    return [row[x] for row in board]
    

class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        for i in range(0, 9):
            row = sorted(filter(str.isdigit, board[i]))
            column = sorted(filter(str.isdigit, get_column(board, i)))
            square = small_square(board, i%3 * 3, i//3 * 3)
            if row != sorted(set(row)) or column != sorted(set(column)) or square != sorted(set(square)):
                return False
        return True
```
