Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        new_level = [root]
        is_null = False
        while new_level:
            last_level = new_level
            new_level = []
            for curr in last_level:
                if curr == None:
                    is_null = True
                else:
                    if is_null:
                        return False
                    new_level.append(curr.left)
                    new_level.append(curr.right)
        return True
```
