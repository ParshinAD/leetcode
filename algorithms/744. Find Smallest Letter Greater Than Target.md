You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

# first solution

```Python
class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        if letters[-1] <= target:
            return letters[0]
        for letter in letters:
            if letter > target:
                return letter
```

# binary search

```Python
class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        if letters[-1] <= target:
            return letters[0]

        left = 0
        right = len(letters) - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if letters[mid] <= target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return letters[left]
