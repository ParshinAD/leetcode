There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

## My stack solution

 ```Python
 class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        visited = set()
        provinces = 0
        for start_city in range(len(isConnected)):
            if start_city not in visited:
                visited.add(start_city)
                stack = [start_city]
                while stack:
                    city = stack.pop()
                    visited.add(city)
                    for way, con in enumerate(isConnected[city]):
                        if start_city < way and con and way not in visited:
                            stack.append(way)
                provinces += 1
        return provinces
```

## And my dfs solution
```Python
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        visited = set()
        provinces = 0

        def dfs(i):
            for way, conn in enumerate(isConnected[i]):
                if conn and way not in visited:
                    visited.add(way)
                    dfs(way)
        
        for i in range(len(isConnected)):
            if i not in visited:
                dfs(i)
                provinces += 1
        return provinces
```
