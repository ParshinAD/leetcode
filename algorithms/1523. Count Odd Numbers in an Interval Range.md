Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

```Python
class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        if not low % 2:
            low += 1
        if not high % 2:
            high -= 1
        return (high - low) // 2 + 1
```
