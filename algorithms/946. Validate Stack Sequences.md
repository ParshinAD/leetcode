Given two integer arrays pushed and popped each with distinct values, return true if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or false otherwise.

```Python
class Solution:
    def validateStackSequences(self, pushed: List[int], popped: List[int]) -> bool:
        pop_ind = 0
        result = []
        for push in pushed:
            result.append(push)
            while result and popped[pop_ind] == result[-1]:
                result.pop()
                pop_ind += 1
                if pop_ind >= len(popped)-1:
                    return True
        return False
```
