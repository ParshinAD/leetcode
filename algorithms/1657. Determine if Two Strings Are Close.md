Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:


Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.

For example, abcde -> aecdb

Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.

For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.


Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.

```Python
class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        letter_count1 = {}
        letter_count2 = {}
        if len(word1) != len(word2):
            return False
        
        for i in range(len(word1)):
            letter_count1[word1[i]] = letter_count1.get(word1[i], 0) + 1
            letter_count2[word2[i]] = letter_count2.get(word2[i], 0) + 1
        
        if letter_count1 == letter_count2:
            return True
        
        if (letter_count1.keys()) == (letter_count2.keys()) \
                                and sorted(letter_count1.values()) == sorted(letter_count2.values()):
            return True
        
        return False
```
