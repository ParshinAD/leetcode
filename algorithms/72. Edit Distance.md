Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

```Python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        # create start point for the dp matrix
        dp = [[0]* (len(word1)+1) for _ in range(len(word2)+1)]
        dp[0] = list(range(len(word1)+1))
        for j in range(len(word2)+1):
            dp[j][0] = j
        
        # fill in the dp matrix
        for i, letter2 in enumerate(word2):
            i += 1
            for j, letter1 in enumerate(word1):
                j += 1
                insert = dp[i][j-1] + 1
                delete = dp[i-1][j] + 1
                if letter1 == letter2:
                    replace = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    replace = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
                dp[i][j] = min(insert, delete, replace)
        return dp[-1][-1] 
```
