Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1, text2):
        """
        :type text1: str
        :type text2: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        n, m = len(text1), len(text2)
        d = [[0] * (m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(1, m+1):
                insertion = d[i][j-1]
                deletion = d[i-1][j]
                match = d[i-1][j-1] + 1
                missmatch = d[i-1][j-1]
                if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                    d[i][j] = max(insertion, deletion, match)
                else:
                    d[i][j] = max(insertion, deletion, missmatch)
        return int(d[n][m])
```
