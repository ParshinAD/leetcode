Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
  
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

```Python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        numbers_history = set()
        numbers_history.add(n)

        while n != 1:
            n = reduce(lambda total, x: total + int(x)**2, list(str(n)), 0)
            if n in numbers_history:
                return False
            numbers_history.add(n)
        return True
```
