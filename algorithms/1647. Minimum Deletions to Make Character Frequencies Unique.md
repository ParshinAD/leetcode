A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.

Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.

The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.

```Python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_count = Counter(s).values()
        char_count = Counter(char_count)
        result = 0
        
        for i in range(max(char_count.keys()), 0, -1):
            if i in char_count and char_count[i] != 0:
                result += char_count[i] - 1
                char_count[i-1] = char_count.get(i-1, 0) + char_count[i] - 1
            
        return result
```
