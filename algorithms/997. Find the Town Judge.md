In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

- The town judge trusts nobody.
- Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
- There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
- You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

```Python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if n==1:
            return 1
            
        people_trust = {}
        trust_to_somebody = set()
        for i in trust:
            people_trust[i[1]] = people_trust.get(i[1], []) + [i[0]]
            trust_to_somebody.add(i[0])
        for key, value in people_trust.items():
            if len(value) == n-1 and key not in trust_to_somebody:
                return key
        return -1
```
