You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 ``` Python
 class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = 0
        r = len(height) - 1
        max_size = 0
        while l != r:
            water_container = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)
            if water_container > max_size:
                max_size = water_container
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            else: 
                r -= 1
        return max_size
```
