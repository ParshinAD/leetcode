The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows: 

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.

Given n, return the value of Tn.

```Python
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        T0, T1, T2 = 0, 1, 1
        for i in range(n):
            T0, T1, T2 = T1, T2, T0 + T1 + T2

        return T0
```
