Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

## First simple solution
```Python 
# Runtime = 5016 ms
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        for i in range(x//2+3):
            if i*i > x:
                return i-1
```

## Second solution
```Python
# Runtime = 40 ms
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        low = 0
        high = x//2 + 3
        while low + 1 < high:
            mean = low + (high - low)//2
            if mean * mean > x:
                high = mean
            else:
                low = mean
        return low
            
```
