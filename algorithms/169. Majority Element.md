Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

```Python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        candidate = 0

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num

            if candidate == num:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
        
        return candidate
```
