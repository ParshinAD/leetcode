There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points):
        """
        :type points: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        points = sorted(points, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))
        result = 1

        curr = points[0][1]
        for balloon in points:
            if balloon[0] <= curr and balloon[1] >= curr:
                continue
            else:
                result += 1
                curr = balloon[1]
        return result
```
