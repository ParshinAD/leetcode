We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).

1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).

0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.

```Python
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        low = 1
        hight = n
        while low <= hight:
            mid1 = low + (hight-low)//3
            mid2 = low + (hight-low)//3 * 2
            if guess(mid1) == 0:
                return mid1
            if guess(mid2) == 0:
                return mid2
            if guess(mid1) == -1:
                hight = mid1 - 1
            elif guess(mid2) == -1:
                low = mid1 + 1
                hight = mid2 - 1
            else:
                low = mid2 + 1
```
