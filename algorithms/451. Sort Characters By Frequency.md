Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

 ```Python
 from collections import Counter
class Solution(object):
    def frequencySort(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        count = Counter(s)
        return ''.join(x * count[x] for x in sorted(count, key=lambda x: count[x], reverse=True))
```
