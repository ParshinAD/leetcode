Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

## My DP solution (O(n*sqrt(n))
```Python
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        counts = [0] * (n+1)
        perfect_squares = [i*i for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1)]
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            # print(i)
            counts[i] = 10e4
            for sq in perfect_squares:
                # print(sq, i)
                if sq <= i:
                    new_count = counts[i-sq] + 1
                    if new_count < counts[i]:
                        counts[i] = new_count
        return counts
```
