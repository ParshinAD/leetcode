There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

Some intuition : 
- The starting station can be determined by starting at some stationa(say, a = 0) and noting whether a station b on the circuit is unreachable due to lack of gas. If all are reachable, then a is our answer. If not, our answer is not a, nor is any station between a andb.
- We reset the tank to zero and repeat on the remainder of the string s

## Greate solution

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas, cost):
        """
        :type gas: List[int]
        :type cost: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
            return -1

        tank, ind = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            if tank < 0:
                tank = 0
                ind = i + 1
        
        return ind
```



## Naive solution

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas, cost):
        """
        :type gas: List[int]
        :type cost: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        def naive_solution():
            diff = [gas[i] - cost[i] for i in range(len(gas))]
            for i in range(len(gas)):
                curr = 0
                for j in range(len(gas)):
                    ind = i + j if i + j < len(gas) else i + j - len(gas)
                    curr += diff[ind]
                    if curr < 0:
                        break
                    if j == len(gas)-1:
                        return i
            return -1
        return naive_solution()
```
