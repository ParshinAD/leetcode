There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.

### Iterative solution

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms):
        """
        :type rooms: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        stack = rooms[0][:]
        visited = set()
        while stack:
            curr = stack.pop()
            if curr not in visited:
                visited.add(curr)
                for key in rooms[curr]:
                    stack.append(key)
        visited.add(0)
        if len(visited) == len(rooms):
            return True
        return False
```

### DFS Solution
```Python
class Solution(object):
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms):
        """
        :type rooms: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        visited = {0}
        def dfs(x):
            for room in rooms[x]:
                if room not in visited:
                    visited.add(room)
                    dfs(room)
        dfs(0)
        return len(rooms)==len(visited)
```
