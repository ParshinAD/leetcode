You are given an m x n integer array grid where grid[i][j] could be:

- 1 representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
- 2 representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
- 0 representing empty squares we can walk over.
- -1 representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePathsIII(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.ansv = 0

        M, N = range(len(grid)), range(len(grid[0]))

        zeros = sum(row.count(0) for row in grid)
        start = [(r, c) for r in M for c in N if grid[r][c] == 1][0]

        def dfs(x, y, zeros):
            grid[x][y] = 3

            for dx, dy in ((-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 0), (0, 1)):
                row, col = x + dx, y + dy
                if row in M and col in N:
                    if grid[row][col] == 0:
                        dfs(row, col, zeros-1)
                    if grid[row][col] == 2 and zeros == 0:
                        self.ansv += 1
            
            grid[x][y] = 0
        dfs(start[0], start[1], zeros)
        return self.ansv
