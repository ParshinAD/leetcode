There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.

You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.

## My slow solution

```Python
class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        self.best_price = -1
        end_entries = False
        d = {}
        for start, end, price  in flights:
            d[start] = d.get(start, []) + [(end, price)]
            if end == dst:
                end_entries = True
        if not end_entries:
            return -1

        def rec(curr, visited, total_price):
            if curr == dst:
                if self.best_price == -1 or total_price < self.best_price:
                    self.best_price = total_price
                return
            if len(visited) > k or (total_price > self.best_price and self.best_price != -1) or curr in visited:
                return 

            for end, price in d.get(curr,[]):
                rec(end, visited ^ {curr}, total_price + price)

        rec(src, set(), 0)
        return self.best_price
```

# Good DP solution with table

```Python
def findCheapestPrice(self, n, flights, src, dst, k):
        dp = [[sys.maxsize for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(k+2)]
        for i in range(k+2):
            dp[i][src] = 0
        for i in range(1, k+2):
            for f in flights:
                if dp[i-1][f[0]] != sys.maxsize:
                    dp[i][f[1]] = min(dp[i][f[1]], dp[i-1][f[0]] + f[2])
        return dp[k+1][dst] if dp[k+1][dst] != sys.maxsize else -1
```
