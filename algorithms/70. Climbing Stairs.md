You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

```Python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        lhd, rhd = 1, 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            lhd, rhd = rhd, lhd + rhd
        return rhd
            
```
