Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).

The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).

```Python
class Solution:
    def computeArea(self, ax1: int, ay1: int, ax2: int, ay2: int, bx1: int, by1: int, bx2: int, by2: int) -> int:
        x1 = max(ax1, bx1)
        y1 = max(ay1, by1)
        x2 = min(ax2, bx2)
        y2 = min(ay2, by2)
        inter_width = x2-x1
        inter_height = y2-y1
        inter_area = max(inter_width, 0) * max(inter_height, 0)
        box1_area = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1)
        box2_area = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1)
        union_area = box2_area + box1_area - inter_area
        return union_area
```
