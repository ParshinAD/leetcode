A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of `0`'s (possibly none), followed by some number of `1`'s (also possibly none).

You are given a binary string s. You can flip `s[i]` changing it from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`.

Return the minimum number of flips to make `s` monotone increasing.

```Python
class Solution(object):
    def minFlipsMonoIncr(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        right_zeros = s.count('0')
        left_ones = 0
        result = right_zeros + left_ones

        for char in s: 
            if char == '0':
                right_zeros -= 1
            if char == '1':
                left_ones += 1
            result = min(result, right_zeros + left_ones)
        return result
```
