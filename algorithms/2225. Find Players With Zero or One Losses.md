You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.

Return a list answer of size 2 where:

- answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
- answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
- The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

Note:

- You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
- The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.

```Python
class Solution:
    def findWinners(self, matches: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        all_teams = set([i for j in matches for i in j])
        lose_count = dict(zip(all_teams, [0]*len(all_teams)))
        for match in matches:
            lose_count[match[1]] += 1
        result = [[], []]
        for team in sorted(all_teams):
            if lose_count[team] == 0:
                result[0].append(team)
            if lose_count[team] == 1:
                result[1].append(team)
        return result
```
