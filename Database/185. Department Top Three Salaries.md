### Question
The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.
```
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```
The Department table holds all departments of the company.
```
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```
Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows.
```
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

**My solution**
```# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Department, Employee, Salary
from (
    SELECT 
        d.name as Department, 
        a.name as Employee, 
        a.salary as Salary,
        DENSE_RANK() over (Partition by a.DepartmentId order by a.departmentId, a.salary desc) as rnk
    from Employee as a
    left join Department as d on(
        a.departmentId = d.id
    )
) as b
    where b.rnk in (1,2,3)
    order by department, salary```
